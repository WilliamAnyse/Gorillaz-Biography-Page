       <h1>Bakground Information</h1>
        <p>Gorillaz was created in 1998 by Murdoc Niccals decided that he wanted to be famous by making a band. Murdoc started his journey by trying to find memebers for his band. While trying to impress random people on the street by doing car tricks, he crashed through the window of keyboard emporium injurying one of the employees. This employee was 2-D, who after being hit by a car was put into a catatonic state and forced to join murdoc's band. The next member to join the band was Russell Hobbs, who was kidnapped from his record store because of his experience as a drummer. After hearing the beats that Murdoc and 2-D cooked up, he decieded to stay and join the band. With all that remained being a guitarist, the 3 members of the band decided to put up an advertisement asking for any guitarists in the UK. Within one week a package showed up with a 7 year old girl named noodle inside, after preforming very well on guitar, they decided to let her join the band. </p>
