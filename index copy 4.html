    <p>Damon Albarn was born in 1968 in Whitechapel london to a middle class home. After living a fairly normal life and going to a college of arts, he started the band "The Blur" with some friends from university. Although the band never offically broke up, they have had many long hiatus. During their first haitus Damon worked with Jamie Hewlett to create Gorillaz. Jamie Hewlett was born in 1968 in West Sussex, and had a fairly normal upgringing similar to Damon. However while working on a comic with a friend in university, he was scouted to do art for a magizene. This continued his path of becoming a comic book artist, which all culminated in 2000 when his flatmate Damon Albarn and him decided to make Gorillaz. </p>
